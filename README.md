Temporary repo to demo some issues we're seeing with the crowdin action. 

Specifically: 
- The source files are not uploaded as we expect they should be. We only get one en.json that looks like it's in the root directory, and the other 4 files get ignored. 
- The resulting translations are ignored. Follow-up issue from the first?

Link to the actual issue I created to be added ‚è≥
